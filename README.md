# IMPORTANT

The algorithm **only works** on the **first video** "video_cut.mp4". Due to a lack of time, I only had time to make one working correctly.

# Execution

For the execution, introduce this command in your terminal.

```python3 main.py --substractor KNN --input video_cut.mp4 --mode 0```

# Videos

In the folder of 'videos_gen' is stored the tracking video and the binarization of the images in order to obtain detections.
